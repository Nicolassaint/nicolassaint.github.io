## Description

This project involves fine-tuning a FLUX.1 [dev] model using my own face as the dataset. By leveraging the computational power of an A100 GPU, the model was trained to recognize and generate personalized outputs based on facial features.

## Key Steps:

- **Dataset Preparation**: Collected and preprocessed images of my face to create a training dataset.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Finetuning the FLUX.1 [dev] model using LoRa framework and AI-toolkit.

This project demonstrates the power of personalized AI models and the performance boost provided by high-end hardware like the A100 GPU.
