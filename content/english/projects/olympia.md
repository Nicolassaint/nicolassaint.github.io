## Description
OlympIA is an AI web application for the French Ministry of Economy and Finance. It gathers different AI tools under one interface, making it easier for users to access and use them. 

Here are the tools that can be used withing OlympIA:

### **Chatbot**:
- **Vanilla Chatbot**: A chatbot built using an open source LLM.
- **RAG Chatbot**: A chatbot built using a custom RAG pipeline.
- **Web Search**: A tool that allows the chatbot to search the web for information.

### **Document Summarization**:
- **Summarization Pipeline**: A pipeline that allows users to summarize documents with the numbers of words they want.

### **Document Database**:
- **Database**: A database that allows users to store and query documents.

I developped the POC of OlympIA using Python, Streamlit, LangChain, Tavily API, and Meta's llama models running on a NVIDIA A100 GPU.
